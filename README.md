# JavaScript-Testing
This documentation shows one of the famous technical tests as a developer, the added value is to do it with testing.

## What is testing?
Testing in programming refers to the technique of evaluating the quality of a program or system. The main objective of testing is to identify errors, bugs, or defects in the code, in order to correct them and improve the performance and functionality of the software.

In the context of Node.js, Jest is a popular testing framework used to perform automated testing in JavaScript projects. Jest allows you to define and execute tests for individual functions, modules, and components of an application.

With Jest, you can create test suites that contain multiple individual tests. Each test is described in terms of what is expected to happen in response to a specific input or action. For example, you can write a test that checks that a function correctly adds two numbers, or that a route in a web application returns the expected response.

In summary, Jest is a useful tool for Node.js developers who want to ensure that their code works correctly and without errors before implementing it in production.

## Description
In this repository you will find two test examples, the first will help you understand how Jest works and its logic. In the second we will solve a very common exercise in technical tests, the famous FizzBuzz.

## Getting Started
